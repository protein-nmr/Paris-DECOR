R. Dass, E. Corlian√≤, F. A. A. Mulder, ChemPhysChem 2019, 20, 231.# requires: MATLAB https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html # All inputs are entered into input_script.m. All other '.m' files should be in the same folder. # Input1: experimentally observed peak intensities for each CPMG block. # eg. data=[intensity_cpmg2 intensity_cpmg4 intensity_cpmg8 intensity_cpmg16 intensity_with_decoupling(WALTZ65)] # Input2: noise level for each experiment.# eg. noise=[noise_cpmg2 noise_cpmg4 noise_cpmg8 noise_cpmg16 noise_with_decoupling(WALTZ65)] # Input3: peak labels. # eg. label=['A','B','C'] # Other inputs: list of cpmg pulses,  length of cpmg period, coupling constant, length of 90 pulse of the decoupling # Output: # rates (k) for each peak (run time: approx. 1 min per peak) # uncertainity (k_unc) calculated by a given no. of Monte carlo iterations. (run time: approx.5 min per peak for 100 iterations) # plots of fitting for each peak (saved in .svg format). A 'test.mat' dataset is attached additionally for the user to test the scripts.
